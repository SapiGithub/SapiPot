# Honeypot with TCP HTTP Payload Detection and TensorFlow for Attack Types

This project focuses on creating a honeypot that specializes in TCP HTTP payload detection using TensorFlow. The honeypot is designed to detect various types of attacks, including Brute Force Attack, Command Injection (Unix), Command Injection (Windows), RFI/LFI, Reverse Shell, SQL Injection, and XSS. It incorporates sentiment analysis to analyze the malicious intent behind the payloads. Additionally, the honeypot includes additional features such as Port Scan Detection (TCP, UDP), ARP Spoof detection, and Folder Monitoring.

## Dependencies
- scapy==2.4.5+g9420c22
- tensorflow==2.12.*
- numpy==1.23.5
- urllib3==1.26.12
- watchdog==3.0.0

## Installation
Used v1.0 just leave the master :)
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SapiGit/SapiPot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd SapiPot
```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Modify the configuration files and settings according to your preferences.

2. Run the honeypot script:

```bash
sudo python3 -m TheSapiPot <config_filepath>
```

3. The honeypot will start listening for incoming connections on the specified ports.

4. Monitor the honeypot logs and analyze the detected attacks.

## Configuration
- `TheSapiPot` - Main script for running the honeypot and handling incoming connections.
- `sapipot.ini` - Configuration file for customizing the honeypot settings.
- `TheSapiPot/model/SentAn` - Directory containing TensorFlow models for sentiment analysis.
- `sapipot.log` - Example of Log file where honeypot logs are stored.
